[Chorus]
D                         D          A
(Stay now) Baby if you've got to go away
      Gmaj7                  D
Don't think I could take the pain
          A7           Gadd9
Won't you stay another day
D         D                   A
Oh, don't leave me alone like this
          Gmaj7              D
Don't you say it's the final kiss
          A7           Gadd9
Won't you stay another day

[Verse]
D         D                   A   G
Don't you know we've come too far now
        D             A7            G     G
Just to go and try to throw it all away
D         D                 A    G
Thought I heard you say you love me
          D              A7         Gadd9
That your love was gonna be here to stay
D         D             A    G
I've only just begun to know you
          D                A7                 Gadd9
All I can say is won't you stay just one more day

[Chorus]

Won't you stay another day

[Verse]
D            D                  A    G
I touch your face while you are sleeping
              D                A7                 G    G
And hold your hand, don't understand what's going on
D             D             A     G
Good times we had return to haunt me
                D              A7             Gadd9
Though it's for you all that I do seems to be wrong

[Chorus]

Don't you say it's the final kiss
          A7           Gadd9
Won't you stay another day
