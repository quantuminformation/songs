 the Lamb upon His throne
(V   I       VI       IIM     V     )
Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns
(I  V     IIM     V   V7            )
All music but its own

Awake my soul and sing

 Of   Him who died for Thee

His glories now we sing

Who died and rose on high

Who died eternal life to bring

And lives that death may die
