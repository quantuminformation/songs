In the Garden
recorded by Loretta Lynn
written by Austin C. Miles and Robert Hebble
[3/4 time]

C
I come to the garden alone
         |F                   C
While the dew is still on the roses
       |G7                   C     Am
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
   |D7         G7
The Son of God discloses

       C                    G7
And He walks with me and He talks with me
       F                 C
And He tells me I am His own
               C7          F     Fm
And the joy we share as we tarry there
     C         G7  |C
None other has ever known


He speaks and the sound of His voice
     |F                         |C
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing

       |G7             C       Am
And the melody that He gave to me
    |D7            |G7
With-in my heart is ringing

       C                    G7
And He walks with me and He talks with me
       F                 C
And He tells me I am His own
               C7          F     Fm
And the joy we share as we tarry there
     C         G7   C
None other has ever known
