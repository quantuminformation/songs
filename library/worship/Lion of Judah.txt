Em                                Em/C
No one knows the tour. No one knows the day
Am           D             Em
Jesus us coming soon
Em                             Em/C
All creation trembles, longing for the day
 Am         D             Em
Jesus is coming soon

(Bridge)

C                     G/B         Bb                F/A
There will be judgment. There will be mercy
 Ab           Bb         C
   On that terrible day
 Em                    G/B       Bb                 F/A
Leaders will bow down. Kingdoms will fall down.
 A6              Bb                                 Csus
  Have you felt your world begin to shake?

(Chorus)
B/D#                             Em
Hear the sound of the Lion of Judah
A/C#                        D
See the fire and the fear in the enemy?s camp
B/D#                             Em                  C          D
From the sound of the Lion of Judah roaring again
B/D#                        Em
There?s a new generation arising
A/C#              Em
A nameless, faceless, placeless tribe
B/C#                       Em
  All they fear is the fear of the Lord
                C              D             Em
All they hear is the Lion of Judah

(Verse 2)
Em                             Em/C
All I saw were bones breaking in the darkness
 Am            D                Em
Then I walked into the light
  Em                           Em/C
There I saw an army coming from the river
        Am           D                 Em
With five stones ready to fight
