F/G        C   Dm  C/E    F    C/E     F
We   are   standing    on holy ground,
F/G   C         Bb          A7         Dm       G
And I know that there   are angels all around.
       C  Dm  C/E  F    C/E  F
Let us praise     Jesus now.
       C/E      F      C/G         G       C
We are standing in His presence on holy ground.

When I walked through the door,   I sensed His presence;
       Dm       Dmj7  G/B          G   C        F/C
And I knew this was a place where love abounds.
Am  Fm/Ab Gm             C           F2            Fm/Bb
For this  is the temple, Jehovah God abides here;
           C/E       Am              Dm          G    C
And we are standing  in    His       presence on holy ground.
