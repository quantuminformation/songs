There's a man goin' 'round takin' names.

An' he decides who to free and who to blame.

Everybody won't be treated all the same.

There'll be a golden ladder reaching down. When the man comes around.

The hairs on your arm will stand up.

At the terror in each sip and in each sup.

For you partake of that last offered cup,

Or disappear into the potter's ground.
   F     G              C
When the man comes around.

One hundred million angels singin'.

Multitudes are marching to the big kettle drum.

Voices callin', voices cryin'.

Some are born an' some are dyin'.

It's Alpha's and Omega's Kingdom come.

C/G
Till Armageddon, no Shalam, no Shalom.

Then the father hen will call his chickens home.

The wise men will bow down before the throne.

Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still.

Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still.

Listen to the words long written down,
   F     G              C
When the man comes around.
