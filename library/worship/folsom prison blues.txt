[Verse 1]
   |E                              |
I h-ear the train a-coming, it's ro-lling round the bend
   |                              |E7
and I ain't seen the sunshine since ~I don't know when
      |A                    |                          |E  | |
I'm st-uck in Folsom Prison, ~and time keeps draggin' o-n
           |B7                                     |E
But that tr-ain keeps a-rollin' on down to San Ant-one


[Verse 2]
    |E
When I was just a baby, my Mama told me 'Son,
                            E7
always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns.'
      A                                      |E
But I shot a man in Reno, ~just to watch him d-ie
       |    B7                                           E
when I h-ear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and cry

[Verse 3]
  E
I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
                                     E7
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
        A                                       E
Well, I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
          B7                                             E
But those people keep a moving, and that's what tortures me

[Verse 4]
              E
Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
                              E7
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
A                                              E
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay
        B7                                       E
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
