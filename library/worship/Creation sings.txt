Creation Sings The Father's Song
He Calls The Sun To Wake The Dawn
And Run The Course Of Day
'Til Evening Falls In Crimson Rays
His Fingerprints In Flakes Of Snow
His Breath Upon This Spinning Globe
He Charts The Eagle's Flight
Commands The New Born Baby's Cry

REFRAIN
Hallelujah, Let All Creation Stand And Sing
Hallelujah, Fill The Earth With Songs Of Worship
Tell The Wonders Of Creations' King

Creation Gazed Upon His Face
The Ageless One In Times' Embrace
Unveiled The Father's Plan
Of Reconciling God And Man
A Second Adam Walked The Earth
Whose Blameless Life Would Break The Curse
Whose Death Would Set Us Free
To Live With Him Eternally

REFRAIN

Creation Longs For His Return
When Christ Shall Reign Upon The Earth
The Bitter Wars That Rage
Are Birth Pains Of A Coming Age
When He Renews The Land And Sky
All Heav'n Will Sing And Earth Reply
With One Resplendent Theme
The Glory Of Our God And King

REFRAIN 2x

Fill The Earth With Songs Of Worship
Tell The Wonders Of Creation's King
