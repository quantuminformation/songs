Into your arms
I'm drawing near again
To dwell with you
It's my only heart's desire
It's my only heart's desire

All I can do
Is fall on my knees and cry
Cleanse me with fire
And purify my heart

Draw me close
Closer than before
Closer than I've ever been

Wrap me in your arms, oh God.
[Repeat]

So take me to that place Lord,
To that secret place where
I can be with you
You can make me like you

Wrap me in your arms
Wrap me in your arms
Wrap me in your arms
