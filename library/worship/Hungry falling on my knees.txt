[Verse 1]

C                Am7
Hungry, I come to You
          G            F
For I know You satisfy
C              Am7
I am empty, but   I know
      G                 F
Your love does not run dry.
          G       F/A
And so I wait for You,
      G/B       F
So I wait for You.


[Chorus]

      C               Fmaj7
I'm falling on my knees,
    C            Fmaj7
Offering all of me.
      C                Fmaj7             C
Jesus, You're all this heart is living for.


[Verse 2]

C                Am7
Broken, I run to You,
           G             F
For Your arms are open wide;
C              Am7
I am weary, but I know
       G                 F
Your touch restores my life.
          G       F/A
And so I wait for You.
      G/B        F
So I wait for You,

So I wait for You.
