  1    |             |        |6m7
The spl-endor of the K-ing, cl-othed in majesty,
                     |42                      |
Let all the earth rej-oice, all the earth rejo-ice.
     }1                          |6m7
He wr-aps Himself in light, and d-arkness tries to hide,
      |                |42                     |
And tr-embles at his vo-ice, trembles at his vo-ice.


Chorus:
       |1          |     5/3
How gre-at is our G-od, sing with me,
       |6m7        |
How gre-at is our G-od, all will see,
       |4         |5           |1
How gre-at, how gr-eat is our G-od.

Verse 2:
 1                        6m7
Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,
                  |42
Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
     1                     6m7
The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,
                 42
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.


Bridge:
 1                   5/3
Name above all names,
 6m7
Worthy of all praise,
     |4
My he-art will sing
       |5          |1
How gre-at is our G-od.
