My lips shall praise You
My great Redeemer;
My heart will worship
Almighty Saviour.

You take all my guilt away,
Turn the darkest night to brightest day,
You are the restorer of my soul.

Love that conquers every fear,
In the midst of trouble You draw near,
You are the restorer of my soul.

You're the source of happiness,
Bringing peace when I am in distress,
You are the restorer of my soul.
