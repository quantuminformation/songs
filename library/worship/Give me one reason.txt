Em                       B/D#
I lived my life for a while,
 A                        E/G#
Asking for signs to believe in
  Em                    B/D#
God played defense in my trial,
   D                   A
Quietly hanging there bleeding
  Em          F#m          Bm
While I cast lots for his robe,
  Em          F#m         Bm
While I point my bloody finger
  Em    F#m           Bm
He pays debts that I owe,
  Em      F#m             Bm
He say?s father forgive them
   Em     F#m        G             Bm
I used to ask for a sign to believe in,
    Em        F#m        G                 Asus
But he never gave me a reason to ever doubt him.
Bm           Bm/D      G         Asus
Give me one reason to doubt He is Messiah
Bm           Bm/D     G        Asus
Give me one reason to doubt He is alive
Bm           Bm/D     G            A          Bm
Give me one reason to doubt I am the apple of His eye
Bm                   Bm/D              Em       G  Asus
Just one reason now, Just one reason to doubt    Ah         (x3)


I see the faith of our fathers
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
They never saw what was promised
But they never once felt forsaken
Through fire, famine, and sword
Tribulation and war
They never asked for signs to believe in
So tell me how we stand in judgement and ever doubt him??
