F                C/E
God will make a way

Where there seems to be no way

He will be my guide

Hold me closely to His side

C#                   Eb
By a roadway in the wilderness
       G#    G#sus
He'll lead me
C#                   Eb        Fsus-F
And rivers in the desert will I see
Bb                    C
Heaven and earth will fade
         Am       A7/C#   Dm
But His word will still remain
Bb          C             D
He will do something new today.
