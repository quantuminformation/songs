G                   C
I long to be His possession
    G        D7   G     D7
For He is my everything
    G         C       G
I remember my days of darkness
                    D7                G
Without sunshine or sight to lead the way
                     C            G
But a whisper of His voice softly calling
                  D7       G
To the arms of my Maker to stay

         D7         G    G7
He is my reason for liv-ing
   C         D7          G
Oh He is the King of all kings
                    C
I long to be His possession
    G        D7   G
For He is my everything

          C             G
After the lightning and thunder
          D7            G
After the last bell has rung
          C          G
I want to bow down before Him
             D7       G
And hear Him say well done
