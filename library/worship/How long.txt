How long, how long
Till I awake in Your likeness
How long, how long
Till I become like You
(x2)
Lord You are calling me to be all Your own
Yet how I struggle to surrender to Your throne
Give me a grace oh God to die that I might live
In You, in You
How long, how long
Till I awake in Your likeness
How long, how long
Till I become like You
Lord You are calling us to be a spotless bride
Raised up in Holy power that cannot be denied
Give us the grace oh God to boldly bear Your name
For You, for You

How long, how long
Till we awake in Your likeness
How long, how long
Till we become like You
How long, how long
Till we awake in Your likeness
How long, how long
Till we become like You
Lord make us one like You
Till we become like You

How long, how long
Till we awake in Your likeness
How long, how long

Till we become like You
Lord make us one like You
