Em  G/F  G  D  C
Em  G/F  G  D  C


[Verse 1]

Em          G/F                 G
You call me out upon the waters
          D                      C
The great unknown where feet may fail
Em          G/F              G
And there I find you in the mystery
      D                       C
In oceans deep, my faith will stand


[Chorus]

C          G             D
And I will call upon Your name
C           G             D
And keep my eyes above the waves
             C
When oceans rise
             G           D
My soul will rest in Your embrace
         C                G
For I am Yours and You are mine


[Instrumental]

Em  G/F  G  D  C


[Verse 2]

Em          G/F               G
Your grace abounds in deepest waters
            D                  C
Your sovereign hand will be my guide
Em             G/F                 G
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
            D                           C
You’ve never failed and You won’t start now


[Chorus]

C          G             D
And I will call upon Your name
C           G             D
And keep my eyes above the waves
             C
When oceans rise
             G           D
My soul will rest in Your embrace
         C                G
For I am Yours and You are mine
C          G             D
And I will call upon Your name
C           G             D
And keep my eyes above the waves
             C
When oceans rise
             G           D
My soul will rest in Your embrace

For I am Yours and You are mine
