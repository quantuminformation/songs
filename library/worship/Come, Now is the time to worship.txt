(I                         IV  I)
 Come, now is the time to worship
(II                        VI   V    I          )
 A                         Em   D    G
 Come, now is the time to give your heart
D                         G   D
Come, just as you are to worship
A                      Em    D    G    D
Come just as you are before your God, Come


CHORUS:
G                            D
One day every tongue will confess you are God
G                        D
One day every knee will bow
G                                          Bm
Still the greatest treasure remains for those
      G               Asus4  A
Who gladly choose you now.
