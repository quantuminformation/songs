 But I found out the h-ard way, there's a pri___ce you have to p-ay.
|Dm7               |Dm7/G     |Cmaj7     |Fmaj7
 I found out that that l-ove,  -was no fr-iend of m-ine.
|Bm7b5                 |Esus4       |E

|Dm7           Dm7/G | Cmaj7                     Fmaj7
 I found that love,       was more than just a game.
Bm7b5                           Esus4         |E|
 You’re playin’ to win, but you lose just the same.


[Chorus]
Am  Em           Am       D9           F9            E7#9      Am

 So long, it was so long ago, but I've still got the blues for you.
            Am            Em           Am          D9
 Though the days come and go, there is one thing I know.
      F9            E7#9      Am
 I've still got the blues for you.
