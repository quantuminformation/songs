|Em       Bm          |Cadd9     D               |G      D   Cadd9   D
 ~But when you hold me n-ear, you drown out the cr-owd
|Cadd9                     |D
|Try as they may, they can never define
G             D           Cadd9         D               |
What's been said between y-our heart and mine
