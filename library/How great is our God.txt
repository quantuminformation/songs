  G                    Em7
The splendor of the King, clothed in majesty,
                    C2
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.
   G                           Em7
He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,
                     C2
And trembles at his voice, trembles at his voice.


Chorus:
    G                          D/F#
How great is our God, sing with me,
    Em7
How great is our God, all will see,
    C           D            G
How great, how great is our God.

Verse 2:
 G                        Em7
Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,
                  C2
Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
     G                     Em7
The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,
                 C2
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.


Bridge:
 G                   D/F#
Name above all names,
 Em7
Worthy of all praise,
   C
My heart will sing
    D             G
How great is our God.
