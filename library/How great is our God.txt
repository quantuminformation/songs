  1    |             |        |6m7
The spl-endor of the K-ing, cl-othed in majesty,
                     |42                      |
Let all the earth rej-oice, all the earth rejo-ice.

He wr-aps Himself in light, and d-arkness tries to hide,
      |                |42                     |
And tr-embles at his vo-ice, trembles at his vo-ice.

The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,
                 42
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.
