Generation Rent (wip)


verse 1
You’re past your prime
you aint got a dime
gotta work the field
cause farmers demand


verse 2
no time for right-side
working this desk job
with people that hate it
longer than family time


chours
generation rent
capitalise everthing
riches to the grave
the more you earn
the more you pay

verse 3
You’re reaching out
for your home
but it keeps moving away
speculation - tribualtion
no one cares, no equity
