verse 1
Oh, you’re past your prime
You ain’t got a dime
Gotta work the field
For supply-on-demand


verse 2
No time for right-side
No family time
Working at the desk
For a job that you hate

chorus
Generation rent
Take your riches to the grave
Seems the less you earn
The more you pay
My speculation
This is Tribulation
When there is nothing more
Than capitalisation

verse 3
Reaching out for your home
It keeps moving away
There is nobody to care,
There’s Zero equity
