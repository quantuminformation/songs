[Intro]
 
C - C - C F - Gsus4
(x2, then drums enter another 2 times)
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
      C                            F   Gsus4
I get up, and nothing gets me down.
            C                                  F    Gsus4
You got it tough, I've seen the toughest around.
       C                             F    Gsus4
And I know, baby, just how you feel.
              C                                          F      Gsus4
You've got to roll with the punches to get to what's real
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
              Am              Am/G
Oh, can't you see me standing here,
            F                C     Dm7
I've got my back against the record machine
C           Dm7               F
I ain't the worst that you've seen.
                         Gsus4
Oh, can't you see what I mean?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               C
Might as well jump. Jump!
                    F      Gsus4
Might as well jump.
           C
Go ahead, jump. Jump!
                F     Gsus4
Go ahead, jump.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
             C
Aaa-ohh, hey you! Who said that?
                  F     Gsus4
Baby, how you been?
                   C
You say you don't know, you won't know
               F    Gsus4
Until we begin.
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
                 Am              Am/G
Well, can't you see me standing here,
             F               C      Dm7
I've got my back against the record machine
C           Dm7               F
I ain't the worst that you've seen.
                         Gsus4
Oh, can't you see what I mean?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
              C
Might as well jump. Jump!
                    F      Gsus4
Might as well jump.
           C
Go ahead, jump. Jump!
                F     Gsus4
Go ahead, jump.
