Key E (1st capo)

[Verse 1]
   |E                              |
I h-ear the train a-coming, it's ro-lling round the bend
   |                              |E7
and I ain't seen the sunshine since ~I don't know when
      |A                    |                          |E  | |
I'm st-uck in Folsom Prison, ~and time keeps draggin' o-n
           |B7                  |                   |E
But that tr-ain keeps a-rollin'  ~on down to San Ant-one


[Verse 2]
    |E                      |
When I was just a baby, my M-ama told me 'Son,
 |                            |E7
a-lways be a good boy; don't e-ver play with guns.'
        |A                                     |E |
But I sh-ot a man in Reno, ~just to watch him d-ie
        |B7                      |                    |E
when I h-ear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and cr-y

[Verse 3]
   |E                                  |
I b-et there's rich folks eatin' in a f-ancy dining car
           |                            |E7
They're pro-bably drinking coffee and sm-oking big cigars
        A                                         |E
Well, I know I had it coming, I know I can't be fr-ee
           |B7                      |                       |E
But those p-eople keep a moving, and ~that's what tortures m-e

[Verse 4]
                |E                                 |
Well, if they fr-eed me from this prison, if that r-ailroad train was mine
   |                           |E7
I b-et I'd move it on a little f-arther down the line
 |A                                               |E |
F-ar from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to st-ay
         |B7                                        |E |
And I'd l-et that lonesome whistle blow my blues aw-ay
