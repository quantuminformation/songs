[Verse]
C/G x4 x4|                         |
There's a man goin' 'round takin' n-ames. 
 
An' he decides who to free and who to blame.
                                    | 
Everybody won't be treated all the s-ame.
                                       Am     F     G            C/G
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down. When the man comes around. 
C/G  |
The h-airs on your arm will stand up. 
                                      |  
At the terror in each sip and in each s-up.
 
For you partake of that last offered cup,
                                   Am
Or disappear into the potter's ground. 
   F     G              C
When the man comes around.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
|C                               C*
 Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers. 
C                               C*
One hundred million angels singin'. 
C                               F   C       G
Multitudes are marching to the big kettle drum. 
 
Voices callin', voices cryin'.
 
Some are born an' some are dyin'.
                                 C
It's Alpha's and Omega's Kingdom come. 
        F                     C
And the whirlwind is in the t-horn tree. 
    C/G
The virgins are all trimming their wicks.
    F                     C
The whirlwind is in the t-horn tree. 
     C/G
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks. 
 
 
[Verse]
 
C/G
Till Armageddon, no Shalam, no Shalom. 
 
Then the father hen will call his chickens home.
 
The w-ise men will bow down before the throne.
                                             Am
And at his feet they'll cast their golden cr-own. 
   F     G            C/G
When the man comes around. 
 
Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still.
 
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still.
 
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still.
                                   Am
Listen to the words long written down, 
   F     G              C
When the man comes around. 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                                C*
Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers. 
C                                C*
One hundred million angels singin'. 
C                               F   C       G
Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettle drum. 
 
Voices callin', voices cryin'.
 
Some are born an' some are dyin'.
                                 C
It's Alpha's and Omega's Kingdom come. 
        F                   C
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree. 
C/G
The virgins are all trimming their wicks.
    F                   C
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree.
C/G
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks. 
                                        Am
In measured hundredweight and penny pound.
   F     G              C
When the man comes around.
